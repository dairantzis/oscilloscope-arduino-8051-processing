# Oscilloscope using Arduino and Processing

### Origin

Forked from the BegOscopio git page of rogeriobego.

### Description

Sampling oscilloscope with 4 channels (voltages from 0 to 5V), with frequencies up to 3kHz.

Square wave generator: F at variable duty cycle and F/2 at 50% duty cycle.  F can be up to 10 kHz.


### System Capabilities

- Monitor up to 4 voltage channels (0 to 5V).

- Can display frequencies up to 3kHz.

- Stabilizes the wave on the screen using a simple trigger.

- Measure the frequency of the displayed signal using the best criterion (square or sinusoidal).

- Scales: volts / division and time / division adjusted individually for each channel.

- Tool to measure voltage and time in each channel.

- Combined display of channels in XY mode.

- Square wave generator.
